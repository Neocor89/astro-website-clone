Exciting news: Vercel now supports automatic, zero-configuration deployments for Astro projects. When you import or create a new project in Vercel, the platform will automatically detect Astro and configure the right settings for your project, including optimized cache headers for your JavaScript and CSS assets.

Vercel is a long-time sponsor of the Astro open source project. Thank you, Vercel, for sponsoring our community and making web development even easier for Astro developers!
